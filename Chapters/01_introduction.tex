\section{Introduction}
In this paper, we show a proof-of-concept of the Rust type-system in the static semantics language Statix. Statix allows for various relations on the scope graph and using scopes as types \citep{antwerpen}. Previously, attempts have been made to express the Rust type-system in NaBL2, the predecessor of Statix; however, this was deemed infeasible. \\
With the introduction of the more powerful Statix, it was thought to be possible to properly express the Rust type-system and its borrow-checker.\\
In \autoref{s:rust}, the necessary bits of the Rust type-system are explained. In \autoref{s:statix}, the relevant parts of the Statix language are explained. How Statix is used to type-check rust is then explained in \autoref{s:implementation}. We then discuss and provide possible future work in \autoref{s:discussion}
