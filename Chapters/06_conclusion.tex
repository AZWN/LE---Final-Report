\section{Conclusion} \label{s:conclusion}
In this paper, we have shown that is possible to implement part of the Rust type-system in Statix. This can be done using constraint rules and by defining relations on the scope and control-flow graph. Using these relations many of the constraints of the borrow-checker can be expressed. However, more work has to be done to fully implement the Rust type-checker. 
Furthermore, more data-flow analysis might be necessary to catch the more advanced cases of borrowing and lifetimes.
